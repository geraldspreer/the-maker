	# Implementation: starting now, all our templates have the 'encoding' node in
	the system_setup.xml the value is set to utf-8 by default.
	When loading an older project (prior to verion 0.8) the maker is assuming 
	latin-1 as encoding since all those earlier projects use latin-1 as default



April 23, 2008			- Gerald

	- renamed makerController method actionPopupTool_img to actionInsertImage
	- added Image selection dialog to the HTML / img function

	- deleted newVersionDialog
	
	- fixed actionCheckForUpdate in the makerController


February 10, 2008 		- Gerald
	- Bugfix makerTemplateDialog

February 9, 2008 		- Gerald
	
	- created new dialog for providing information on app updates
	- also when the maker starts the update check is now done in maker.py
		before the GUI is displayed. The check is NOT threaded anymore
	
	- changes in makerController and makerGUI regarding the search field
		
		The wx.SearchCtrl on the Mac is implemented in a different way than
		on windows. On the Mac it is one native Control on the windows it is
		a composite of three controls. So changing the searchtext color only 
		worked on the Mac. 
		There would have been a workaround, - extract the TextCtrl on windows
		out of the SearchCtrl and the change the text color but this would have
		ment more platform dependent code.
		So I decided to put a status text next to the search field and when the
		string is not found a simple 'String not found!' message appears.
		Feels the same to me from a users perpsctive...

	------------
	- fixed bug in marker replacement inside makerCore.py
	------------
	- new feature: after you edit and save a .dynamic file the maker is creating a 
	list of files affected by this change. These files are then rebuilt and queued for
	upload
	
	
	
	------------
	- new method in makerCore 
		
		FindContentFilesContainingThisDynamic(self, dynamic):
        """
        is returning a list of all the .content files containing a reference
        to a certain dynamic
        """

	------------
	FTP QUEUE
	____________
	
	I have been working on the maker a lot and wanted to let you know what is going on.
	The original idea was that when a .dynamic file is saved that the user does not have to make 
	all since he might not remember in which .content files this dynamic is used.
	
	So now after saving a .dynamic file all the files hat make use of this .dynamic are queued for ftp
	upload. The publish feature is uploading that queue.
	
	Since I had this possibility I make the ftp queue that standard procedure for all files. Simply
	when you save a file it is added to the queue. Then you can edit another file and another without
	having to remember which ones you changed. Then just hit publish and the maker will work its way
	thru the queue.
	
	Of course if a file is already in the queue it is not added again. After it is sent to the server it is removed from the queue.
	
	When the maker is closed, or the project is changed, before the queue is publised it is saved (pickled) for the next 
	session on the project. 
	
	All this is very useful and makes working with the maker even more intuitive.

	- - -
	new methods in makerCore 
	
		*InitFtpQueue(self):
        *self.SetFtpQueue([])
        *SetFtpQueue(self, files):

			maker.py.
			
		- Finalising implementation of more filetypes
			makerController method CheckIfToolIsRight , the .content tool
			tool is now also supporting .html and .php files
			
		- did some (a lot of) work on makerGUI
		  * re- written .Bind code, Menu items are now object instances so we
		    can apply their methods, like .Disable and also re- use them all 
		    over the GUI 
		    
		  * Icons in the tree view
		  
		  * some work with the About menu in makerGUI, got it to appear natively
		   in the Application Menu on the Mac
		    
		    for implementation details see:
			http://wiki.wxpython.org/Optimizing_for_Mac_OS_X
		
		  * the Editor right click menu is now also containing cut, copy and 
		    paste

		- makerController method CheckIfFileIsBinary(self, file)
			returns True or False for importing binary files
			
			* also did changes to ActionImportFile to distinuish between binary
			  and text files on windows
			
			* some fixes regarding Autoselect
			
			
		- makerCore, did fix a Bug in ReplaceInAllItems. Also in the same method
		  there is now a try block since we also have to deal with binary files
		  so the method tries to replace the string but just fails if it is a
		  binary file...
		  
		* also makerCore method AddMakerFile has one more argument: mode 
			  which is lines by default but can be set to binary

		- Added item icons to the items list
		
		

June 1st 2007		- Gerald

		! This code is not complete but for sync reasons I commit today
		
		###
		in the makerCore method I changed the default data that is written to
		the distribution tablen when a file is created. 
		
		- making all other kinds of files managable in order to do this I 
		thought it would be best to create a class for each type of file so 
		we could have different behaviour when calling class methods
		
		

		new methods:
			makerCore:
				- GetAllFilesFromParts
				- GetFileClassForGroup
				
				
			makerFile in makerCore:
				- GetNewFileTemplate
				
			in the makerCore also the makerFile class has a new flag self.edi-
			table and the methods SetEditable() which is setting its value to
			True and GetEditable() which returns self.editable
			
			if a filetype like .mov is not editable this method has to be 
			overridden
						
			
			makerController 
				- in the method ActionTreeSelectItem we are using the makerFile
				method GetEditable to determine wheather we turn the save button
				on or off
				
				- in the ActionAddNewFile the new makerCore method 
					GetNewFileTemplate is being used
		
		-----
		Due to the .htm / .html convention I had to change the Preview method 
		in makerFileDynamic. It is now using the .htm extension like all maker
		created files
		-----
			
						
		I also changed makerGUI method OntreeLeftClick(self, event):
		I took the try: / except: block out

		Renaming maker items... 
		I comitted this to SVN for testing purposes so you guys can have a look
		
		
		-new method in makerCore in super-class makerFile 
			
			Rename(self,newName):
			ReplaceStringInAllItems
        

		- new methods for the purpose of renaming files in the makerController are:

    		SetOriginalName(self, Name):
        	GetOriginalItemName(self):
        	ActionEditTreeItemLabel(self, event):
	    	VerifyNewName(self,event):
	    	ActionOnEditTreeItem(self, event):
	    	ActionTreeEditFinish(self, event):
	       
        
       - new methods and bindings in the makerGUI
	       	self.tree.Bind(wx.EVT_LEFT_UP, self.OntreeLeftClick)
	        self.tree.Bind(wx.EVT_RIGHT_DOWN, self.OntreeLeftClick)
	        # This binding is calling the same method as EVT_LEFT_UP because
	        # before the item can be renamed it has to be selected
	        #
	        self.tree.Bind(wx.EVT_RIGHT_UP, self.OntreeRightUp)
	        self.tree.Bind(wx.EVT_TREE_BEGIN_LABEL_EDIT, self.OntreeEdit)
	        self.tree.Bind(wx.EVT_TREE_END_LABEL_EDIT, self.OntreeEditEnd)

			OntreeEdit
			OntreeEditEnd
			BindVerifyer
			UnbindVerifyer



2. April 2007	- Gerald
		"Make All" had the following problem:
		If the connection dies you have to start over again and if it is a large project
		 you will eventually never make it through. 
		 therefore:
	- changes in makerServerlink method upload:
		after an attempt has failed the method is logging out
        from the server, is establishing a new connection and is trying
        again. Still for 10 times at the most



30. March 2007 - Gerald
		- changes in makerController, ImageGUI and makerImage
			if an Image is stored in the same dimensions as the original
			then it is not scaled and not converted if the format is the same
			too. The original file is renamed and used...
			
						



19. March 2007 	- Gerald	release 0.6.2
		- one last change in makerController ActionProjectSetup
			if the setup is cancelled then the last selected file is
			active again


19. March 2007	- Gerald
		- in makerProjectSetup.py the Label next to the root_ctrl text field
			was too long thus making it impossible to edit the text field
			- fixed
			
		- in makerProjectSetup.py method CheckFtpSettings() if the controller
		 small changes
		 
		- in the makerController method CheckIfPasswordIsSet the number of 
			attempts has been limited to 3 after that the maker quits
		new methods to do this in makerController
				GetPassAttempts(self):
       			IncPassAttempts(self):
        		ClearPassAttempts(self):
       
       - the makerController method CheckIfPasswordIsSet is now returning
       True or False all the calls of this method have been updated to this
       		ActionDeleteCurrentFile
       		ActionPublish
       		ActionPublishAll
       		ActionUploadFile
       		ActionDeleteImage
       


16. March 2007	- Gerald
		- minor changes in makerController / ActionDeleteCurrentFile
			Removed the call for RestartCore from where it was unneccessary
				eg. in ActionAddNewFile
		



16. March 2007 	- Gerald	rev 100
		- in the makerController method ActionImport file in the last line of
		the def there was a call to RestartCore. This was not necessary so I
		replaced it with core.LoadGroupItems and self.ActionFillTree
		This way the imported file appears in the items list
		
		- I also did a change in ActionCssTool_style in makerController because 
		the inserted CSS was actually incorrect


15. March 2007 - Gerald
		- minor layout related changes in makerProjectSetup.py
		- changed some syles in style_stc in makerGUI

		- changes in makerController method	ActionNewProject, the system folder
		now remains static, therefore it can be bundled with the app
		or can be in a place where the user has only reading permissions
		
		- changes in the makerController method ProjectProcedure()
			fixing BUG # 1673910 "Closing start up dialog crashes theMaker" 


13. March 2007	- Gerald
		- after make all and the user does not want to upload all files
			the last active file is also selected.
			modified method: ActionUploadAll


12. March 2007	- Gerald 
		
		- in the makerServerlink.py method upload I limited the number of
		  attempts for storing to 10
		- fixed a Bug in Language switching
		- fixed the make all Bug !
			Updated the methods ActionMakeAll, ActionPublish, ActionUploadAll, 
			ActionBuildAll, ActionPublishAll
			
		- makerController changes
			after make all the last active item is selected bu the Autoselect
			method. By this the make all bug is fixed!
			also new methods SetLastUsedItem and GetLastUsedItem


8. March 2007 	- Gerald
		- commented out event.Skip() in method OnDeleteFile() in makerGUI
		- in the makerGUI I changed in the method ExpandTree from
			Expand(rootItem) to ExpandAll it appears more logical since 
			newly created items are immediately visible
	
		new makerController method SelectNothing()
			"""
	        is unbinding the text change event in the editor
	        is clearing the editor
	        is setting core.currentFile to None

		the makerController method ActionPublish
		is now prompting the user to save the file 
		if the currentFile has not been saved



6. March 2007	- Gerald 	rev 93
		- corrected mistake in makerGUI.py
			methods BindModifiedToEditor and UnbindModifiedToEditor
			the event used has to be STC_CHANGE and not STC_MODIFIED which
			leads to Errors on Windows because the event is also
			triggered when style changes are made and if one does
			AddText(content) to a STC on Windows it appears to take a 
			while until the text is styled
		- also added the style feature wx.EXPAND to toolbar1


6. March 2007 	- Gerald	rev 92
		
		- deleted Dialog1.py since deprecated

25. February 2007 	- Gerald

	Did some minor changes in GUI Layout to cope with wxPython 2.8.1.1
	The new wxPython hanldes events different so I had to disable some event.Skip() calls
	other changes:
		makerProjectSetup, all settings have to be done by the user in the correct way.
		Version 0.6.1 did auto-connect the url and ftp root setting to reduce setup errors
		but this causes problems due to the differences in how Hosting Providers layout their
		servers.
 		I deleted the browser button for the image folder. The user has just to enter the name....
 		
 		Deleted some obsolete files...
 		

22. February 2007	- Gerald

			after the user has set up his projects Ftp settings for 
			the first time.
			- the method is not finished...
			
			I also added a stack for Progress Bars to the makerGUI
			The stack is a list object. The purpose is the ability to have
			multiple progress bars and the "destruction" of them in order they appear.

	January 1, 2007 	- Gerald
			- HAPPY NEW YEAR !!!
			- Fixed a Bug in UpdateImageBase
			- Fixed a Bug in makerProjectBrowser 


	December 20, 2006 	- Gerald
			new module makerProjectConverter
				- is converting old maker projects to be compatible with the new  maker version
			
			
			

	December 19, 2006 	- Gerald
		
		I have written so much code that it would be hard to do comments on everything.
		So far the-maker has been looking for his projects in his own working directory and 
		has been reading the projects from the projects/ folder.
		Now the folder makerProjects represents the place where the projects are stored and can
		be found in the users $HOME directory.
		
		I have been writing several makerController methods that are related to that improvement
		Also when the makerCore is instatiated it needs a project be given to him. Not just a project name
		but a full path.
		
		Also switch Projects is working and a lot of other things that were missing...
		
		In the makerProjects Folder there is also a file called lastProject.txt. This file is uesed to find and load the
		last Project that the user has been working on


	December 11, 2006 	- Gerald
		- makerHistory has new methods
			GetLastImageDir and SetLastImageDir
			this is useful to the import image function so that while importing images 
			the user ends up in the last directory he imported images from
			
			






	December 6, 2006 	- Gerald
		- dynamic files get a "language stamp" foo.dynamic will be foo_en.dynamic when 
		  english is selected
		- added language filter for dynamic files




	December 5, 2006 	- Gerald
		
		- implemented dynamics !
			This is done by the makerCore method UpdateDynamic() which is part of the
			makerFileContent Class
			UpdateDynamic is called be the MakeWebsite Method
			---
			Inside the content of a file the user may enter something like
			<maker_dynamic:foo /> the UpdateDynamic method is replacing that
			with the contents of the file foo.dynamic
			
			
		- Language switching possible
			Deutsch / English
		
		- the makerController method ActionFillTree has got a 
			"language Filter" so that only content Files for the current
			Language are displayed
			
		- each language used to have its own ditribution Table
			from now on it is only one
			
			 




	November 30, 2006	- Gerald
		- been working on the popup tools
			
			

	November 29, 2006 	- Gerald
	
		- makerGUI new methods
			InsertText ... inserts text to styledTextCtrl1
			InsertHtmlTags ... insert html tags into the main editor
        		if text is selected , the tags are wrapped around it
			ShowPopupTool(self,toolset,event)
        	toolset can be either html, css, cgi or whatever
        	this show a popup Menu in the main Editor with items depending
        	on the selected file
        	so far there is popup "Tools" for .content and .css
        	
        - makerController new methods
        	ActionShowPopupTool(self,event) evnent is the GUI event that is sent back to the GUI
        	for further use
              
             
    		ActionPopupTool_h1(self) insert html tags <h1></h1>in GUI Editor 
        	NOTE: there will be a lot more of these Actions
        
        




	November 27, 2006 	- Gerald
		- did some minor changes on makerCore method UpdateFilebase()




	November 22, 2006 	- Gerald (late)
	
		- UpdateImageBase is only replacing occurences with quotes like "foo.jpg"
		  "foo.jpg" will be replaced, but in:
		  		This is some placeholder text for foo.jpg and other images...
			nothing will be replaced.
			
			

	November 22, 2006 	- Gerald
	
		- IMPORTANT the logal image files are stored in parts/ and not anymore in 
		  parts/gfx

		- makerCore new methods
			- GetImageFiles returns a list of all the images
			- BackupLocalFile is backing up the current File for
			  example as myfile.content_local
			- RestoreLocalFile is doing the opposite
			- UpdateImageBase 
			  
			  	this is upadating references to image files from "imgage.jpg" to the
        		"http://server.com/gfx/image.jpg" full path that is needed on the remote server 
        		
        		one image at a time because of GUI interaction
			   
				Note: This is working for all Files css as well as content or whatever
				There is also a method UpdateFilebase in the makerCore this is only for content(html)
				Files.
				Basically the files that are on the remote server differ from the local Files in some 
				ways the references of images <img src="" > and links as well as other references to other files are
				updated on upload
		
		- the makerController has also a new method called ActionUpdateImageBase this is just
		  calling makerCore.UpdateImageBase with some GUI interaction
		
		
		
		

	November 21, 2006 	- Gerald
	
		- makerController has new method ActionUploadFile 
		  this is a generalpurpose upload method with GUI interaction
		- the makerController method ActionAddImage has been added for importing images
		- the makerController method ActionDeleteImage has been added
	
	
		- makerCore new method GetRemoteGfxFolder()
		
		- new module ImageGUI this is the interface for importing and
		  scaling images
		- new module makerImage this does the scaling and such
		
	
	

	Novemer 16, 2006    - Gerald
		-imagetool.py renamed to ImageGUI.py
		-added Menu Item Files / import File 		




	
	November 14, 2006 	- Gerald
		-makerFtpBrowser.py feature complete and working
		 with makerController
		 the makerFtpBrowser is called (displayed) by the 
		 makerController method: ActionBrowseServer()		  
		
		-the module ftp_browser.py was renamed to makerFtpTools.py
		 a doc string was added to makerFtpTools.py
		 
		-in makerGUI.py I renamed all occurences of Page like select Page
		 to File "select File" since we do not deal with Pages only
		 
		-maker GUI has new methods:
		 ExpandTree() expands the root item in the tree View
		 CollapseTree() collapses the root item in the tree View
		 
		 A ExpandTree() call was added to the makerController method
		 ActionFillTree()
		 
		-makerCore method DeleteMakerFile has been improoved
		 DeleteMakerFile is a method for deleting a file and its parts
		 locally
		 
		 
		-makerCore method Distribute is returning a list with all the remote locations of that file
		 this is because the maker does support mutiple remote Targets
		 
		-makerController method ActionDeleteFile is working
		 it removes all remote Files and Copies of a file as well as local Files
		 
!!!		 	TO DO:
		 	the maker does not remove empty folders from the ftp server
